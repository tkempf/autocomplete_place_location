# EXAMPLE MODULE

This example shows how to create a custom module.

All the functions are optional - edit the ones you need, and
delete those that you do not need.

For example, the functions regarding versions, author, support,
etc. are only relevant for modules that you intend to share publicly.

This module does not actually do anything.  Look at the other examples to
see how to add or change specific features.

## How to extend/modify an existing modules

This example creates a new module from scratch (by extending `AbstractModule`).

You can also create a module by extending an existing module.
For an example of this, see <https://github.com/webtrees/example-module-theme>.
